# miofondo
MioFondo brings a variety of wallpapers, sorted by country-category, to your phone.
This Android Application is completely made with Kotlin to show the interaction between Activities and Fragments, using MVP as Architecture and FireStore from Firebase as a backend for the images.

The complete code can be found between the folders, except for the google-services.json that can be obtained on the Firebase console.
The application also uses a default key for ads.
